AI Chatbot using CosmosRP


This project is an AI-powered chatbot built using the CosmosRP. The bot can load custom user identities and conversation histories, providing personalized interactions. It allows users to define their own bot persona through JSON files and even continue previous conversations. With built-in features for customization and session management, this project is ideal for building intelligent, user-friendly chatbots that can learn and adapt over time.

Features:

Customizable Identity: Define the bot's personality by adding your own custom identity file (custom_identity.json).
Custom Conversation History: Load or continue previous conversations, or create new ones using custom_history.json.
Session Management: Continue previous chat sessions or start fresh with a new identity.
CosmosRP API Integration: Uses CosmosRP's large language model API to generate intelligent responses.
Modular Structure: Code is organized into different modules for easier maintenance and customization.
